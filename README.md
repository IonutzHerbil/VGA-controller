# VGA-controller
A VGA controller made in VHDL for Artyx-7 FPGA

This project allows users to select and animate different shapes on a board using various switches and buttons. The shapes can be moved, reset, and have their speed and color adjusted.

Features
Shape Selection: Choose from 8 different shapes using the v10, v11, and v12 switches:
Triangle
Square
Diamond
Octagon
Circle
Smiley Face
Doughnut
Star
Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the shape's movement using the V8 switch.
Shape Movement: Control the movement of the shape using the board's buttons.
Reset Functionality: Reset the shape to the center of the image using the middle button.
Color Selection: Change the color of the shapes using the M13, L1, and J1 switches.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A compatible board with switches v10, v11, v12, V8, and buttons for movement.
